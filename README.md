## WPA/WPA2/WPA3 Hash Cracking Script using Hashcat üòº
This is a Bash script designed to automate the process of cracking WPA/WPA2/WPA3 PMKID or 4-way handshake hashes using a list of wordlists and Hashcat.
The script loops through a list of dictionaries, attempts to crack the hashes, and generates a report.
The script uses a list of dictionaries to attempt cracking with Hashcat (GPU-based, faster) or optionally Aircrack-ng (CPU-based, slower).
Reports are generated dinamically, timestamped for easy organization.

## How to Use ‚öôÔ∏è
### Prerequisites 
- **Hashcat**/**Aircrack-ng**: Ensure Hashcat is installed and properly configured for your system.
- **Wordlists**: Provide the paths to your dictionary files.
- **Hash File**: Ensure the input hash file is in .hc22000 format (e.g., generated from a WiFi PMKID or 4-way handshake using tools like hcxpcapngtool).

### Configuration 
1. update the dictionaries array with the paths to your wordlist files:
```sh
dictionaries=(
"/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt"
"/my/path/hashes.com-hashkiller_io_2024-12_wordlist.txt"
"/my/path/crackstation.net_wordlist.txt"
)
```

2. set the path to your input hash file:
```sh
input_hash="/Vodafone-WIFI-XXXXXX.hc22000"
```
3. customize the output directory for reports if needed:
```sh
output_reports="/WIFI_Cracking/Hashcat Reports/${file_name_input}_${date_format}.txt"
```
### Running the Script
```sh
chmod +x hashcat-multi-cracking.sh
./hashcat-multi-cracking.sh
```
